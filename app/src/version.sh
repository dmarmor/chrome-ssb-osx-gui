# Epichrome version (#.#.#[#] = release version, #.#.#b#[#] = beta)

epiVersion=2.4.0b4
epiBuildNum=37
epiDesc="🚀 MAJOR UPDATE!

   ▪️ Epichrome apps can now be edited by dropping them on Epichrome.app!
   
   ▪️ Added advanced settings during app creation and editing to control how the app handles updates, and to customize its ID

   ▪️ New unified app engine architecture for better compatibility with the dock, notifications, and other system services

   ▪️ Added two new apps, \"Epichrome Scan.app\" and \"Epichrome Login.app\" to restore apps left in an unlaunchable state after a crash

   ▪️ Checking GitHub for updates is now unified across all apps and Epichrome itself, so when a new update is found, you will only receive one notification

   ▪️ Many more improvements and bug fixes (see change log on GitHub for details)"

   # Apps are now automatically backed up whenever they are edited or updated (in the Backups subfolder of the app's data directory)
   # 
   # ▪️ Fixed a problem that could cause apps to register as a browser after update even though they were created not to (existing apps that should not be registered browsers will need to be edited once to reset that setting)
   # 
   # ▪️ Updated built-in engine to Brave 1.13.86
